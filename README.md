# Verilog
This repository contains a focused collection of Digital Logic Design (DLD) projects implemented in Verilog HDL. Every file is designed to be fully self-contained, including both the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code and its testbench, allowing for immediate compilation and simulation of circuits like FSMs and custom logic.
